For forkers: edit magicmethods.mkd, run `python magicmarkdown.py`, and then copy-pasta output (output will be in markedup.html) into magicmethods.html (start pasting at line `<h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>`, should be line 32 or thereabouts). The magicmarkdown script requires markdown, just issue `pip install markdown` and you'll have it.
